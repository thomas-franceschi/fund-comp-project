GIMP: Read documentation and practiced using GIMP to create/manipulate sprites, 
maps, etc. and created a demo sprite for the lab deliverable. Created a sprite 
sheet for a bouncing ball. Allignments was slightly off so some bits gets cut off 
of certain frames.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demo Code:

The demo program I created uses a sprite sheet to render a "bouncing ball," complete 
with compression when it hits the ground. I based this off of the example from lesson 
14 in the LazyFoo tutorials on animation, though I extended it to loop through 10 
frames instead of four for a smoother animation, though it is still pretty choppy. While 
I could have made a better looking ball using the built in geometry rendering, I wanted 
to get practice with creating sprite sheets and implementing them in animation graphics. 
The program works by reading in a sprite sheet and rendering the first 64*500 (w*h) pixel 
block, then moving on to the next 64, and so on untill it hits the 10th block, then the 
counter resests to 0 and it begins again.
