Sunday 3/20/2016 11 pm - 12:30 am:
GIMP: Read documentation and practiced using GIMP to create/manipulate sprites, 
maps, etc. and created a demo sprite for the lab deliverable. Created a sprite 
sheet for a bouncing ball. Allignments was slightly off so some bits gets cut off 
of certain frames.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demo Code:

The demo program I created uses a sprite sheet to render a "bouncing ball," complete 
with compression when it hits the ground. I based this off of the example from lesson 
14 in the LazyFoo tutorials on animation, though I extended it to loop through 10 
frames instead of four for a smoother animation, though it is still pretty choppy. While 
I could have made a better looking ball using the built in geometry rendering, I wanted 
to get practice with creating sprite sheets and implementing them in animation graphics. 
The program works by reading in a sprite sheet and rendering the first 64*500 (w*h) pixel 
block, then moving on to the next 64, and so on until it hits the 10th block, then the 
counter resests to 0 and it begins again.

I created the sprite sheet png file in GIMP, and while the sprites themselves are very 
simple, I spent a large quantity of time learning the ins and outs of GIMP, its commands, 
and the tools it has that we can use in image creation and manipulation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I Learned:

Throughout Lab 7&8 I learned alot about the basic ins and outs of SDL2, such as how to 
load images, make them move on command, render geometric shapes, and animate sprites. It 
was very helpful to learn how to use key inputs as a means for controlling on screen images, 
since we will need to make our character move on command, as well as sprite animation for 
the walking animations/making NPCs move/battle animations. I learned just how much code goes 
into flashing a single image on the screen and it heped me understand the magnitude of the 
project we are taking on in creating a full(ish) pokemon game. I realize that our original 
goal may have been a bit too much and instead we should focus on making a smaller but more 
detailed version using a subset of the Notre Dame campus, pokemon, and battles that we 
originally intended, though it should still be a decently complex/time consuming game to play 
once completed. It aslo helped me learn to think about how we will be implementing specific 
features of our game, specifically in SDL2 and how our code should be structered for maximum 
performance/readability/maintainability. 

I also learned the basics of image creaton and manipulation in GIMP, which will be very helpful 
as we need to create a world, characters, environmental objects, etc from scratch (though we 
may find some sprites to reuse on the internet).
